Description of GIS Workflow:

    Collect Raw Data: Gather GIS data from various sources (satellite imagery, survey data, etc.).
    Preprocess Data: Convert raw data into a format suitable for GIS software.
    Data Cleaning: Remove errors, duplicates, or irrelevant data points from the dataset.
    Georeferencing: Align the data to a coordinate system.
    Digitizing Features: Manually or automatically convert features from raster or paper maps into vector data.
    Create Spatial Layers: Organize data into different layers based on types (e.g., roads, buildings, vegetation).
    Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources to create comprehensive GIS datasets.
    Perform Spatial Analysis: Analyze spatial relationships and patterns using GIS tools.
    Generate Maps & Visualizations: Create maps and visualizations to communicate findings.
    Export Data: Export the results in various formats (e.g., shapefiles, GeoJSON).
    Review & Validate Results: Check the accuracy of the results.
        If data is accurate, the project is completed.
        If not, refine the analysis and iterate
